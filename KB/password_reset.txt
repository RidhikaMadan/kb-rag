PASSWORD MANAGEMENT AND RESET PROCEDURES

SECURITY POLICY OVERVIEW
All employees must maintain strong, unique passwords for all company systems. Passwords must be changed every 90 days to comply with our security standards. Sharing passwords is strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action.

PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS
Your company password must meet the following complexity requirements:
- Minimum 12 characters in length
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
- Cannot be a dictionary word or common phrase
- Cannot reuse your last 5 passwords
- Cannot contain your username or email address

SELF-SERVICE PASSWORD RESET (Recommended Method)
1. Navigate to https://password.techcorp.com
2. Click "Forgot Password" or "Reset Password"
3. Enter your username (usually your email address)
4. Select your verification method:
   - Email verification (sent to your registered email)
   - SMS verification (if you've registered a mobile number)
   - Security questions (if previously set up)
5. Follow the instructions in your verification message
6. Enter your new password twice (must meet complexity requirements)
7. Log in with your new password
8. Update your password in all applications that use single sign-on (SSO)

RESETTING PASSWORD VIA IT HELPDESK
If you cannot reset your password using self-service:
1. Contact IT Helpdesk at helpdesk@techcorp.com or ext. 2000
2. Provide your full name, employee ID, and department
3. Verify your identity using one of the following:
   - Answer security questions
   - Provide information from your employee record
   - Have your manager verify your identity
4. IT will provide a temporary password (you must change it on first login)
5. Log in and immediately change to a new password of your choice

PASSWORD EXPIRATION NOTIFICATIONS
You will receive email notifications:
- 14 days before expiration
- 7 days before expiration
- 3 days before expiration
- 1 day before expiration
- On the day of expiration

If your password expires, you must reset it before you can access any company systems.

MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)
All employees are required to enable MFA for additional security:
- Download the company-approved authenticator app (Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator)
- Scan the QR code provided during setup
- Use the 6-digit code from the app when prompted during login
- Keep backup codes in a secure location

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
Issue: "Password does not meet requirements"
Solution: Review the password requirements above and ensure your password meets all criteria.

Issue: "Cannot receive verification email"
Solution: Check your spam folder, verify your email address in the system, or contact IT Helpdesk.
